          This competition, hosted by the University of Michigan, will take place in mid-2018.  The basis is to construct a lower body exoskeleton capable of helping first responders in rescue operations.  Skills involved include complex and safe mechanical engineering, control theory, and sensing.  The competition is in its inaugural year, so we hope to establish ISU Robotics Club as a leader in this competition.
