            <h4> Through the help of our sponsors, we are able to build projects, provide outreach events, travel to competitions, and grow as a team. Since our club is project based, and each project requires both monetary and gifts-in-kind donations, it is vitally important that we reach out for any and all help in-order for our club to grow. Please allow us to state in advance that we are very grateful for any contributions you have made in the past and will be making in the future.  </h4>

        <h4> Our club is willing to work with any and all sponsors in a collaborative effort to represent them. Some examples of representation have been sponsor logos on shirts, logos and links on our site, and logos on our banners and posters. Similarly, during our competition presentations, we always make it a point to share who were our sponsors.  </h4>
