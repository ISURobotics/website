            <div class="col-lg-5"> The purpose of this project is to design, build and operate a fully autonomous snowplow for the purpose of removing snow from a designated path. This project requires mechanical, electrical, and software expertise. What makes this project unique in the world of robotics is its heavy focus on path planning combined with location sensing and obstacle avoidance. All of this is combined in an environment where mechanical ability and sensors can be highly limited. With the rise of autonomous vehicles, the importance of solving these problems is at an all-time high. In this project, we aim to provide a unique solution to these problems in an attempt to advance such an important field of research.  </div>

            <div class="col-lg-4" style="margin-left: 60px;"> Last year two major events happened that set this project up for success. First, we designed and built, thanks to our sponsors, a plow capable of competing in the most rigorous winter environments. This plow was designed with the idea that it would be used in many future competitions. Second, we brought ten team members to the ION Snowplow Competition in St. Paul Minnesota, where we competed against seven other teams. Although we weren't able to take home the win, we took home an endless supply of ideas for the following year. </div>

            <div class="col-lg-5" style="margin-right: 50px;"> Major changes in the year to come encompass all aspects of our design. Mechanically, we plan to change our motors, although powerful enough, were not owned by the robotics club. We also intend to alter our drive shaft to motor connection to better accommodate torque distribution. Electrically, we intend to better regulate our battery temperature with a shell casing and incorporate sensors and reactive measures when our system changes. SICK Sensors donated a lidar, and we intend to use this to sense the world. We are intending to construct a better software architecture that incorporates a more proactive approach to our sensing and a faster reactive approach to our mechanics. Our team is currently working on these upgrades and we are excited to see where this project will be within half a year.
