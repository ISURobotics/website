                    <p>The Autonomous Snowplow is a project motivated by a competition in January where the goal is to clear a predefined section of snow using a plow no larger than two-meters square, running on its own power and controlled autonomously. This project requires mechanical, electrical, and software expertise, an original design, and all done by members of the Iowa State Robotic Club. More of this project can be seen at the competition website located at the URL in the bottom of this section. Weâ€™ve been working on this project for months, in order to ensure the best robot, we can build goes to competition. Below is a summary of our expected timeline. </p>
